    overview:
      "Fried puff puff is a popular Nigerian snack made from deep-fried dough balls. While tasty, it is high in calories, fat, and carbohydrates due to the deep-frying process. Consuming fried puff puff regularly can contribute to weight gain and may not align with your weight loss goals. Additionally, during menstrual periods, it's beneficial to focus on nutrient-dense foods that help alleviate symptoms and support overall health.",

  shawarma: {
    overview:

The meat is then shaved off and served in a pita or wrap with various toppings such as vegetables, hummus, and sauces. While shawarma can be a tasty and convenient meal option, it may not be the most suitable choice for someone following a vegan diet, especially during menstruation when iron and nutrient needs are higher. The meat in shawarma is high in protein and fat, but lacks the essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are important for overall health and managing menstrual symptoms. Additionally, the sauces and toppings used in shawarma may be high in calories, sodium, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to bloating, cramping, and other menstrual discomforts.',
